# Semantic Segmentation
### Introduction
A pixel wise segmentation of drivable path using Fully Convolutional Neural-Network (FCN).

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```

### Discussion
The network implemented in this project is based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06211.pdf).    

### Result
Some of the images obtained after training:
